## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:

- Run `npx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `npx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Comments

Default to no comment. Write one only for a constraint, an external quirk, or an invariant the code can't show, in one line where you can and four at most. Don't restate names, narrate steps, record history, or explain the fix you just made; the PR carries that.

- Full sentences ending with a full stop, including notes after code on the same line.
- No required verb form, and no "we" or "our".
- JSDoc on exported props, options and functions: one sentence, no types, no empty `@param` or `@returns`.
- A `TODO:` links the issue that tracks it. No bare `#123`.
- No section dividers, commented-out code, or test step labels.

`tablecn/comment-style` in `lint/comment-style.ts` enforces the mechanical parts, and `.claude/hooks/lint-comments.ts` runs it on every file Claude edits.
